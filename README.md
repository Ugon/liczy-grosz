### Prerequisites
It is necessary to have a `Java 1.8` distribution installed (or an equivalent one with the `JavaFX` library configured).
### Running
1. Create a MySQL database named `to2` and a default user with the `root` name and the blank password.
2. Run a `to2project(root) -> package` Maven goal.
3. An executable `*.jar` file is located under: `app/target/to2project.app-1.0.jar`.
4. Run the aforementioned archive by typing: `java -jar to2project.app-1.0.jar`.
  
An alternative way:
1. Create a MySQL database named `to2` and a default user with the `root` name and the blank password.
2. Run the application in your IDE by choosing the `pl.edu.agh.iisg.to.to2project.app.core.ApplicationMain` class.
